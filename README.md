# Material-Classification-using-CNN-and-SVM
**Introduction**: Classification model using CNN to classify materials into an existing material class by processing the images extracted from the research papers. The final classifier used for the model is SVM for better accuracy. The dadaset for the model generation is created by extracting images from research papers of material science discipline. Post extraction the images are cleaned and augumented.

**Notes**: The files uploaded are .ipynb extension and can be opened using google colaboratory.

*This project is done as a master project for CMPE295. It is done by a group of four members.*
